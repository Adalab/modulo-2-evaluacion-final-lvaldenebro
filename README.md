# Project's title: Breaking Bad, dead or alive?

## Description

Welcome Breaking Bad lover! If you think this is best series of all times, as well as if you only try to spoiler someone, the following page will help you to find the characters and check if they are dead or alive! ;)

## Technologies

This web page was made using HTML5, SaSS, plain JS, advanced DOM, localStorage and a request to an API(https://breakingbadapi.com/api/) and the Adalab Web Starter Kit, who uses NodeJS, Gulp and JSON.

Please, take into account that all HTML, SaSS and JS files are divided in partials:

- In the case of JS files, they are ordered by number following the moment the code is used. The name is descriptive referring at the content they manage.
- In the case of HTML and CSS, they are related, each HTML file has one SaSS file associated named after it. All of them have descriptive names according to the place of the page they are developing or working on.

## Table of contents and How to Use the Project

### Main landing

This assignment has only one page:

- Header: Shows the title and a input place in which you can search for a character's name. This input has a filter so you can both check for a exact name or a peace that think will match some character. E.g.; 'ky' will return 'Skyler White'.

- Main: It is divided in two sections:
  - Characters: This section shows the result of the filter if applied. Here you can select the characters that are your favorites, this will make the background color change and they will be added into Favorites section. By clicking again in one of them, you will delete them from your favorites.
  - Favorites: this sections receives your favorites characters, with the favorites special background color, and adds them a cross in which you can delete them. There is a reset button too, to delete all your favorites.

As this page works with localStorage, don't you worry if your page is reloaded against your will, because all the information you added, will be there when you come back :)
